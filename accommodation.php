                    <h3>Our Founders </h3>
                    <p>Clinic Phaselis is founded by two successful doctors who idealized creating a brand-new clinic providing medical services on plastic surgery, dental treatments, bariatric surgery and hair transplant.
                        <br><br> Being a respected Internal Medicine Specialist and a Respected Oncologist, they served as a consultant to numerous surgeries.
                        <br><br> Working in the field more than 10 years, managing thousands of patients enabled them to witness the obstacles of the patients face while visiting a country for a surgery abroad.
                        <br><br> Observing shifts in demand they gathered significant information from the heart of the medical tourism field.
                        <br><br> They realized that for an excellent experience, precise pre-surgical evaluation and an outstanding patient-care is needed along with an experienced surgeon and team.
                        <br><br> We, as Clinic Phaselis, developed a ‘Medical Excellence Model’ to overcome these obstacles, which fulfills these demands, placing the patient in the core of the system and making the patient their only priority.
                        <br><br> Our strongest objective is to give the best results and surgery experience with the best patient care.
