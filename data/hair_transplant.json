    "treatment_details_en": "<h3>Hair Transplant</h3><p>Hair transplantation is a surgical technique that removes hair follicles from one part of the body, called the 'donor site', to a bald or balding part of the body known as the 'recipient site'. The technique is primarily used to treat male pattern baldness.

Hair transplantation can also be used to restore eyelashes, eyebrows, beard hair, chest hair and pubic hair <br><br>Since hair naturally grows in groupings of 1 to 4 hairs, current techniques harvest and transplant hair follicular units in their natural groupings. Thus modern hair transplantation can achieve a natural appearance by mimicking original hair orientation. This hair transplant procedure is called follicular unit transplantation(FUT). Donor hair can be harvested in two different ways: strip harvesting, and follicular unit extraction (FUE).<br><br>Follicular unit extraction (FUE) is a type of hair transplant done by taking individual hair follicles from your skin and moving them to another part of your body where hair’s thinner or absent.<br><br>DHI is a modified version of FUE hair implantation and follows a similar procedure.
