The balloon is endoscopically inserted into the stomach. It takes roughly 20 to 25 minutes to complete the treatment. A diagnostic endoscopy is conducted first to make sure you don't have any medical conditions that would prevent the balloon from being placed (such as an ulcer). A soft, deflated balloon made of silicone elastomer-based material is put into the stomach if no abnormalities are found. The treatment is completed once the balloon is put in your stomach and filled with a blue liquid via a filling tube (catheter) linked to the balloon. Within the stomach, the balloon begins to float freely.Based on the amount of weight reduction desired and the type of balloon used, intragastric balloons are categorized into two categories: those intended to stay in the stomach for six months and those intended to stay in the stomach for twelve months. The risk of balloon rupture increases if the balloon remains in the stomach for longer than planned. It is recommended that the balloon be removed as soon as possible.Gastric Balloon Surgery is appropriate for individuals between the ages of 18 and 55 who have a BMI of more than 27 and are unable to lose weight despite dieting.<br><br>As Clinic Phaselis, we perform Gastric Balloon Surgery at internationally accredited hospitals.We are waiting for you in Antalya Turkey with our board-certified doctor staff and medical team speaking your mother tongue.</p>",
